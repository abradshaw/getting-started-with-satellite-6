# Adding Puppet Repositories

One of the very powerful features of Satellite 6 is the inclusion of Puppet. This allows you to define and esure the configuration of your servers by creating puppet modules

You can create repositories to hold the puppet modules your have created and/or you can syncronise 3rd party puppet repositories such as Puppet Forge, from Puppet Labs

# Domains

Next we do the same for Domains. The first domain should have been setup by the installer. With your orgainisation and location selected, go to

```Infrastructure > Domains```


and check that your domain is visible.

If its not visible go to the "Any Organisation" and see if its there, if it is, click on it and make sure that you add the correct Location and Oragisation to it. Then switch back to your organisation again

# Provisioning Templates

One of the changes from the beta version is that read only copies of provisioning templates are copied to your location and organisation but they are read only copies.

If you want to change one of them, then you will need to clone it

This is a nice last minute change (from the beta) as editing one template doesnt affect other orgs

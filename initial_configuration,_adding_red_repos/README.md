# Initial Configuration, adding Red Hat Repos

The following sections will cover adding different repositories (or repos) to the Satellite server, starting with the official Red Hat repos.

Each type of repo can either be synchronised on demand or alternatively can be scheduled to synchronise on a regular basis.

Before we can add Red Hat repositories, we need to create an organisation and location then create and import a manifest file however.

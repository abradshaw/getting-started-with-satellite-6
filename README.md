# Getting Started with Satellite 6

## Introduction

Red Hats latest version of their Lifecycle Management tool, Red Hat Satellite 6, is a big change from earlier versions

Version 5 was based on the upstream, open source project called [Spacewalk](http://spacewalk.redhat.com/), which also included the [Cobbler](http://www.cobblerd.org/) project, where as the latest version is a combination of a few other open source projects - [Katello](http://www.katello.org/) & [Foreman](http://theforeman.org/).

Foreman itself is also a cobination of open source code written by themselves and and open source project called Puppet (by Puppet Labs). While Katello is also a combination of [Candlepin](http://www.candlepinproject.org/) and [Pulp](http://www.pulpproject.org/)

As such, while the latest version has the potential to do much more and scale far beyond earlier versions, with this comes some more complexity.

###About the book

<u>We shall use defaults where-ever possible</u>

### About you
